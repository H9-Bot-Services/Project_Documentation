# Bot Services: Educational Support Tool with Intelligent Agents

## General Description

This project aims to provide an innovative tool to benefit both teachers and students through the use of specialized intelligent agents. Our goal is to create a scalable and adaptive system that enhances learning and facilitates educational management.

The core idea is to assign intelligent agents with specific roles and responsibilities, rather than centralizing multiple specializations into a single agent. This approach enables efficient scalability and precise customization in educational environments with large user volumes.

## Our Goal

- Create a bot that adapts to the specific needs of each student.
- Implement a system where each intelligent agent has a specific role and responsibility, facilitating the management of millions of users.
- Support teachers in managing large classes by providing automated analyses and suggestions to improve student performance.

## Features

### Specialized Intelligent Agents
- Each agent has a clearly defined role (e.g., tutor, evaluator, performance analyst).

### Student Adaptability
- Agents analyze error patterns and adapt their approach to help students overcome their weaknesses.

### Scalability and Modularity
- Modular design that allows adding new agents or roles according to future needs.

## Benefits

- Improves academic performance through personalized approaches.
- Reduces the administrative workload for teachers.
- Scales to handle large user volumes without compromising quality.
- Promotes adaptive and continuous learning.
